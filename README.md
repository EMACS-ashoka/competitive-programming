# Competitive Programming
### Links
1. [SIR Tracking for Problems and Concepts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JmtBO5hw4YnwrMiVnJ0FoiQ4gOqrF1kgSCqTMFLO7ew/edit#gid=0)

### Goal
Achieve Grandmaster rank on codeforces

### Dissect the Goal
1. Learn from a problem such that you can solve the same problem and similar problem without any help as well as use the concepts of the problem in order to get ideas for other problems.
2. Consistently practicing everyday and reviewing old questions.
3. Problem solving ability
4. Implementation skills
5. Problem identification

### Evaluate your level (corresponding to dissected goal)
1. Not good at this right now. I know I'm not good at this because I don't have any system of SIR which allows me to practice old problems. I haven't done much in this regard.
2. Not good at all. Not practicing consistently at all. I know this because I just don't.
3. I think my level is okay okay with scope for massive improvement. I know this because a lot of times I get stuck and then stop thinking altogether or repeat thought patterns. Getting stuck and stoppping thinking are bad for problem solving must be true for my assessment to be correct. With regards to Problem Solving Process (PSP), I first scope out viable plans, then I try the most promising approach, then I try other approaches till one of them works.
4. Not very good. I still need to look up a lot of basic details which should have been memorized by now. There are lots of basic subroutines which I also have to look up. My understanding of my tools isn't too great.
5. I don't even know how good I am at this.

### How to be 1% better
1. Just spend 10-20 minutes thinking about the key lessons from a problem and then stick them in a database that you create
2. Spend atleast 1 hour on Competitive Programming everyday where the first 10 minutes involve reviewing old concepts according to SIR
3. Observe your PSP more intentionally and if there is something that doesn't make sense, do a Kolb's on it.
4. Observe your implementation of an idea. Be more intentional and do a Kolb's if you think negatively / postively about something.
5. For this just identify a random problem from UVa
