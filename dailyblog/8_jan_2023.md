# Journal
### 7:26 PM
I'm facing a few issues that need to be addressed - 
1. There's no clear workflow that I currently have. Everything is haphazard. There's no clear process that is being followed right now. The only thing I know is that I'm following CP4 as my primary resource, but how I'm doing it is uncertain.
2. There's no atomicity of study material. I'm not doing topic-wise study yet, and I keep going into deep aspects of a single topic. There's nothing wrong with that, but there should be some primary structure.
3. I don't have a list of things that I've done in a particular day, so that's troublesome. That should be there.

In order to solve these issues and keep a track of daily progress, this journal has been initiated. I'll stick to this particular format of naming `day-of-month_month_year`.

With regards to the first issue, Each type of problem in CP4 can be a topic in itself and I can try to study CP4 topicwise. This should work.
